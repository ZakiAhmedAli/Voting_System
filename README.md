# Voting_System
Based on a communication protocol(UART)

Here I am showing a microcontroller based project called the “UART Based Voting System“. Using this system you can ask your users to vote for any of the four options. Four available options are identified by the numbers ‘1, ‘2’, ‘3' and ‘4’. Users can vote for any option by sending an option by mobile app or using a terminal.
